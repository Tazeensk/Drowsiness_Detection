Alternatively, you can generate the requirements.txt file automatically if you have already installed the necessary packages in your Python environment.
To do this, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
This command will create a requirements.txt file containing all installed Python packages and their versions.
Make sure you are in the correct virtual environment (if you're using one) to capture only the dependencies needed for your project.
