# Drowsiness Detection

This project implements a drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques and a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. It detects whether the eyes of a person in front of a webcam are open or closed, and alerts if drowsiness is detected.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies by following the instructions in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the `drowsiness_detection.py` script.
3. The webcam feed will open, and the application will start detecting drowsiness in real-time.

## Requirements

See the `requirements.txt` file for a list of required Python packages.

## Credits

This project is based on [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for computer vision tasks and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for deep learning.
